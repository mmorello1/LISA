How to contribute to documentation ?
===================================

Documentation for LISA can be found at http://lisa.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.  There are still plenty of open peices that need to 
be written.  On http://lisa.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/development/contributing.html  you can find instructions for creating a
fork in your local repository.  From the documentation website, this can be done from the "Edit On Github" link in the upper right
of any page.  Direct any questions regarding the documentation to the Q&A website https://waffle.io/seraf/lisa.  After editing the documentation
send a pull request from your local fork.
